# university-projects
These are the projects that I would like universities to look at to prove my problem-solving skills, and clean way of writing code.

Welcome to the university-projects wiki!
This is a Github Repo by Caiden Tousaw, used to show universities my coding ability and application of readable code into real-world settings.

Please find in this repo the code I have written for my Python Class, written to learn a new language, and fun side-projects I have taken on in my free time.
