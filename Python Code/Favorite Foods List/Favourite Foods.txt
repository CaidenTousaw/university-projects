This is a program that will create an empty list that will be filled with the "favorite foods"
of whoever wants to use the program. This list can be filled with anything, but is supposed to be for food.
This program has a couple interesting things though, seeing as if you type 'list,' it will show your list
and then will go back to asking for things to append. You can also type 'stop,' which will stop adding to
the list, and print your final list.
